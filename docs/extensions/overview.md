DuckDB has a number of extensions available for use. Not all of them are included by default in every distribution, but DuckDB has a mechanism that allows for remote installation.

## Remote installation

If a given extensions is not available with your distribution, you can do the following to make it available.

```sql
INSTALL 'fts';
LOAD 'fts';
```

If you are using the Python API client, you can install and load them with the `load_extension(name: str)` and `install_extension(name: str)` methods.

## Unsigned extensions

All verified extensions are signed, if you wish to load your own extensions or extensions from untrusted third-parties you'll need to enable the `allow_unsigned_extensions` flag.  
To load unsigned extensions using the CLI, you'll need to pass the `-unsigned` flag to it on startup.

## Listing extensions

You can check the list of core and installed extensions with the following query:
```sql
select * from duckdb_extensions();
```
